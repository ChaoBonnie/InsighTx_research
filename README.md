A machine-learning approach to human ex vivo lung perfusion predicts transplantation outcomes and promotes a safe increase in organ utilization

Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is a field in lung transplantation that generates large quantities of donor lung data on a regular basis. In this documentation, we describe how the tabular data generated during EVLP can be used to guide transplant decisions. We implemented a decision tree model called XGBoost, which is the state-of-the-art machine learning method for analyzing healthcare data. Because the purpose of this project is to implement an existing, trained model on new data, we will only discuss how to perform inference in this document.

This repository allows for training and evaluation of processed EVLP data.
